# SPMD-Simulations
Repository to support simulations of mixing segments for single pair multi-drop networks.

## Goals

The goal of these simulations is to provide a model which combines the best traits of each of the existing SPMD mixing segment models into one consensus model. This allows the broader group to do what-if experiments on a wider variety of network topologies.


## Simulation Tools

Most models here are based on LTSpice, which can be downloaded for free and carries a permissive license.
